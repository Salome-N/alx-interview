# <ins>**Must Know**</ins><br>
- For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:
## <ins>**Concepts Needed**</ins>:<br>
1. Lists and List Manipulation:<br>
	- Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.<br>
	- [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)<br>
2. Graph Theory Basics:<br>
	- Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.<br>
	- [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs)<br>
3. Algorithmic Complexity:<br>
	- Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.<br>
	- [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymptotic-notation-and-analysis-based-on-input-size-of-algorithms/)<br>
4. Recursion:<br>
	- Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.<br>
	- [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)<br>
5. Queue and Stack:<br>
	- Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.<br>
	- [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/)<br>
6. Set Operations:<br>
	- Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.<br>
	- [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)<br>
<br>
- By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.<br>
