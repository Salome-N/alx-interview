# <ins>**Must Know**</ins><br>
- To successfully complete this project, you should revise the following Python concepts:<br>
## <ins>**Concepts Needed**</ins>:<br>
1. Lists and List Comprehensions:<br>
	- Understand how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists.<br>
	- Utilize list comprehensions for more concise and readable code, especially for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.<br>
2. Functions:<br>
	- Know how to define and call functions.<br>
	- Pass parameters and return values, particularly how to return a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.<br>
3. Loops:<br>
	- Use `for` and `while` loops to iterate through sequences.<br>
	- Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.<br>
4. Conditional Statements:<br>
	- Apply `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle (e.g., the edges of the triangle always being 1).<br>
5. Recursion (Optional):<br>
	- While not strictly necessary, understanding recursion can provide an alternative approach to generating Pascal’s Triangle.<br>
	- Recognize base cases and recursive cases for a function that generates the triangle’s rows.<br>
6. Arithmetic Operations:<br>
	- Perform addition, a fundamental operation for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle as the sum of the two elements directly above it.<br>
7. Indexing and Slicing:<br>
	- Access elements and slices of lists, crucial for identifying and summing the correct elements when constructing each row of the triangle.<br>
8. Memory Management:<br>
	- Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied, especially when creating new rows based on the values of the previous row.<br>
9. Error and Exception Handling (Optional):<br>
	- Use try-except blocks as needed to handle potential errors, such as invalid input types or values.<br>
10. Efficiency and Optimization:<br>
	- Consider the time and space complexity of different approaches to generating Pascal’s Triangle.<br>
	- Evaluate and apply optimizations to improve the performance of the solution.<br>
<br>
- By revisiting these concepts, you will be well-prepared to tackle the challenges of implementing Pascal’s Triangle in Python, applying both your mathematical understanding and programming skills to develop an efficient and effective solution.<br>
